# py_ssl


Here the cert file and private key files can be created using the open source tools like openssl. I used x509 architecture and a 2048 bits of RSA key for encryption and a public key certificate.

"name.crt" is the public key certificate file.
"key.pem" is the private RSA key 
server.py and client.py are self explainatory.

I have Attached the ca-bundle.crt with this, which enables the client.py to even connect to realtime sites. ;)
